## Welcome to Python Data Science: Task Views

Task Views is a collaborative open source project that aims to provide guidance on which python packages are relevant 
for tasks related to a certain data science topic. It is loosely inspired by the R ecosystem [CRAN views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)  

Task views are intended to outline which packages could be included (or excluded) in a certain project to achieve certain
functionality. They are *not* meant to endorse the "best" packages for a given task. 

## Moderators
Anybody who has good knowledge of python tools used in a specific data science domain is welcome to contribute to the knowledge base.
Similar to CRAN, we want to have a small number of moderators per topic to help organize the content

## Python versus R comparison
While those pages are dedicated exclusively to Python data science tools, the side-by-side comparison with the R packages
helps identify important sub-domains [Python vs R Comparison](https://www.openriskmanual.org/wiki/Python_versus_R_Language)
