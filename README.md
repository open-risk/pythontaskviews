## Welcome to Python Data Science: Task Views
[Task Views](https://www.pythondatascience.org/) is a collaborative open source project that aims to provide guidance 
on which python packages are relevant for which data science task. 

## Python versus R versus Julia overview
While Task Views are dedicated exclusively to Python data science tools, the project is inspired by the R 
ecosystem [CRAN views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/). A side-by-side comparison with R and Julia packages 
available for data science helps identify important sub-domains where Python may currently lag. The overview is
available in two formats:
* As a wiki page: [Jupyter Overview Wiki](https://www.openriskmanual.org/wiki/Overview_of_the_Julia-Python-R_Universe). 
* As a markdown document: [Jupyter Overview Markdown](Overview.md)

Task views aim to outline which packages could be included (or excluded) in a certain project to achieve certain 
functionality. They are *not* meant to endorse the "best" package for any given task. 

## Moderators
Anybody who has good knowledge of python data science tools used in a specific domain is welcome to contribute to the 
knowledge base. Similar to CRAN, we want to have a small number of moderators per topic to help organize the content 
and ensure it is a high quality resource that adds value to all users.

## How Does it Work?
Each Task View lives in a separate file hosted in this repository. Those files are automatically displayed 
in a [Github Pages website](https://www.pythondatascience.org/)

## Task Views
The initial proposed list of python task views mirrors the CRAN set. Over time this may develop to 
reflect more accurately the grouping of tasks in the Python universe
