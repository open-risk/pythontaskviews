## Welcome to Python Data Science: Task Views
[Task Views](https://www.pythondatascience.org/) is a collaborative open source project that aims to provide guidance on which python packages are relevant for which data science task. 

## Python versus R comparison
While Task Views are dedicated exclusively to Python data science tools, the project is inspired by the R ecosystem [CRAN views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/). A side-by-side comparison with the R packages available for data science helps identify important sub-domains where Python may lag. [Python vs R Comparison](https://www.openriskmanual.org/wiki/Python_versus_R_Language). 

Task views aim to outline which packages could be included (or excluded) in a certain project to achieve certain functionality. They are *not* meant to endorse the "best" package for any given task. 

## Moderators
Anybody who has good knowledge of python data science tools used in a specific domain is welcome to contribute to the knowledge base. Similar to CRAN, we want to have a small number of moderators per topic to help organize the content and ensure it is a high quality resource that adds value to all users.

## How Does it Work?
Each Task View lives in a separate file hosted in this repository. Those files are automatically displayed in a [Github Pages website](https://www.pythondatascience.org/)
