## Python Task Views: Regression Methods

Packages offering regression methods functionality

* The first column indicates the specific method and / or functionality along with a documentation link where the mathematics of the method is documented in detail
* The second column has links to functionality offered by lower level packages (where available) 
* The third column has links to the standard statistical packages (scikit-learn and statsmodels)
* The fourth column has links to more specialized packages
* The fifth column has any further remarks
